DESCRIPTION OF ALL LAB TASKS:

week 1:
  Task 1 - Declaring and Initializing Variables
          
          Objective: Practice declaring and initializing variables of different types in C++.
          Instructions:
          1.	Write a C++ program that declares and initializes variables of the following types:
          a.	int, float, char, and string.
          2.	Display the values of these variables on the console.
          3.	Change the values of the variables after initializing them and display the updated values.
          Example Output:
          Initial values: 
          Name: Alice, Age: 20, Height: 1.65, Grade: B
          
          Updated values:
          Name: Bob, Age: 22, Height: 1.75, Grade: A

  Task 2 - Arithmetic Operations with User Input

          Objective: Practice performing basic arithmetic operations.
          Instructions:
          1.	Write a C++ program that accepts two integers from the user.
          2.	Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (using type casting for float division), and modulus on the two integers.
          3.	Display the results of each operation.
          
          Example Output:
          Enter the first number: 12
          Enter the second number: 5
          •	Addition: 17
          •	Subtraction: 7
          •	Multiplication: 60
          •	Division: 2.4
          •	Modulus: 2

  Task 3 - Variable Scope and Lifetime
          
          Objective: Understand the scope and lifetime of variables in C++.
          Instructions:
          1.	Write a program that demonstrates the use of local, global, and static variables.
          2.	Create a function that increments a local variable, a static variable, and a global variable.
          3.	Call this function multiple times and observe the behavior of each type of variable.
  
  Task 4 - Type Casting and Conversion
          
          Objective: Understand implicit and explicit type casting in arithmetic operations.
          Instructions:
          1.	Write a program that accepts two integers and performs the following operations:
          a.	Implicit type conversion in division.
          b.	Explicit type conversion (using static_cast) to cast one of the integers to a float before division.
          2.	Display the results of both operations and explain the difference in your comments.
          
          Example Output:
          Enter the first number: 15
          Enter the second number: 2
          •	Result without type casting (integer division): 7
          •	Result with type casting (float division): 7.5

  Task 5 - Complex Arithmetic Expression and Precedence

          Objective: Practice writing complex arithmetic expressions while understanding precedence and associativity.
          Instructions:
          1.	Write a program that calculates the result of a complex arithmetic expression using multiple operators (+, -, *, /, and %).
          2.	Ensure the expression uses parentheses to change the default precedence order.
          3.	Display the result of the expression with and without parentheses and explain the difference.
          Example:
          -	Without parentheses: 5 + 3 * 2 / 4 - 1
          -	With parentheses: (5 + 3) * (2 / (4 - 1))
          Example Output:
          -	Without parentheses: Result = 5
          -	With parentheses: Result = 5.33
